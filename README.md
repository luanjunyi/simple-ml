# Introduction

This is the algorithms I wrote on the way from full stack developer to hard-core machine learning hacker.

They are built as simple as possible while being `correct`. Being simple is key in writting software and especially for
machine learning models, which are often complicated due to the amount of math invovled.

Hopefully, this repo will become your go-to toolkit when investigating new dataset on day to day work.

# Supported Models
* Logistic Regression
* Linear chain Conditional Random Field(CRF), working in progress
