# Introduction

This is the algorithms I wrote on the way from full stack developer to hard-core machine learning hacker.

They are built as simple as possible while being `correct`. Being simple is key in writting software and especially for
machine learning models, which are often complicated due to the amount of math invovled.

`simple-ml` use the same convention of skearn and other python stack whenever possible. The key difference of `simple-ml` comparing to sklearn is that everyone can change the code reasonably easy to debugging the training process. After all, this is the purpose of any script: config file is for ever-changing constants, script is for ever-changing logics.

Hopefully, this repo will become your go-to toolkit when investigating new dataset on day to day work.

# Supported Models
* Logistic Regression
* Linear chain Conditional Random Field(CRF), working in progress
